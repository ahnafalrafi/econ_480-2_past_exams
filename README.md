# Northwestern University ECON 480-2: Solutions to Past Exams

This repository contains solutions to past exams for the second part of the
three-part first year econometrics sequence at Northwestern University. These
will be somewhat more verbose than the official solutions.

The document can be compiled using the GNU `make` utility, or using `latexmk` -
whichever you prefer. The `makefile` uses `latexmk` in its compilation rules. If
you use GNU Emacs as your editor and the
[`auctex`](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/) package to deal with TeX files,
you can use [`auctex-latexmk`](https://github.com/tom-tan/auctex-latexmk) to
compile this document. The multi-file structure is dealt with by using
`.dir-locals.el` to tell Emacs what the main TeX file is. There are other ways
to deal with multi-file projects. Use whatever suits you after cloning this
repository.

The order in which exam questions are answered (as tracked by commits to this
repository) can be arbitrary. They pretty much appear according to whims and
other (potentially causal) factors. A bored graduate student may even decide to
study what factors are causal if they so wish.
